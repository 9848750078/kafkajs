Hi Sai: Please test this. Once I confirm this work as expected i will add to confluence.
A Python script that uses the Snowflake Connector to retrieve the masking policies associated with table columns in Snowflake:
import snowflake.connector

def get_masking_policies(account, user, password, database, schema, table):
    # Establish a connection to Snowflake
    conn = snowflake.connector.connect(
        account=account,
        user=user,
        password=password,
        database=database,
        schema=schema
    )

    try:
        # Create a cursor object
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        # Query to get masking policies associated with table columns
        query = f"""
        SELECT column_name, masking_policy
        FROM information_schema.columns
        WHERE table_name = '{table}'
        AND table_schema = '{schema}'
        AND table_catalog = '{database}'
        AND masking_policy IS NOT NULL;
        """

        # Execute the query
        cursor.execute(query)

        # Fetch the results
        results = cursor.fetchall()

        # Print the results
        for row in results:
            print(f"Column: {row[0]}, Masking Policy: {row[1]}")

    except Exception as e:
        print("Error fetching masking policies:", e)

    finally:
        # Close the cursor and connection
        cursor.close()
        conn.close()

# Example usage
account = 'your_account'
user = 'your_user'
password = 'your_password'
database = 'your_database'
schema = 'your_schema'
table = 'your_table'

get_masking_policies(account, user, password, database, schema, table)

A Python script that uses Boto3 to update an LF-tag in AWS Lake Formation:
import boto3

def update_lf_tag(tag_key, tag_values, catalog_id=None):
    # Initialize a session using Amazon Lake Formation
    client = boto3.client('lakeformation')

    # Prepare the request parameters

        'TagValuesToAdd': tag_values
    }
    if catalog_id:
        params['CatalogId'] = catalog_id

    try:

This script initializes a Boto3 client for Lake Formation, prepares the parameters for the update_lf_tag method, and updates the LF-tag with the specified key and values. You can customize the tag_key, tag_values, and catalog_id as needed.
Let me know if you need any further assistance or modifications!

john message:in service now there is a number of roles sf_rg_col_spii and npii. each role appears to be setup to address a diffrent masking strategy related to certain column types. i think that is not needed in LF setup, as we are not masking. byt rather filtering .therefore, is it reasonable to have just 3 roles: 1) LF_SPII 2) LF_NPII 3) LF_GENERAL? am i right in thinking this all that is needed since we are filtering in DL and not masking (or am i missing a details)?

sukalya reply: i am just thinking out loud here.. lets say user can see drivers lincense but not address.. and what if both are classified as NPII.. how will that work?

john reply to sukalya on above message:
so please confirm, but i was assuming that for the most part SPII is SPII. your role allows access to it or not. i was assuming that the reason for the number of roles of roles was to address different masking strategies. if there is a need to be granular within SPII(or NPII), then i think we may be able to address the fine grained details with polices. let me confirm my thinking and how to showcase it, but i think this could be more efficient and maintainable.

sukalya reply on above message: i'll have to check with jeff on this and get back to you.


Mean while I will do create role pii and nii roles and as per masking policy which columns I identify those things I will differentiate separate and add to roles the accordingly
